30.11.2010 - Version 0.2
+ GUI Configurator nealy finished, generates shellscripts only batch files will follow.
+ Began to create a simple project editor, it has become more complex than intended. But it is as it is
+ fixed some issues with the XML Manipulator Framework. Is is more flexible now
+ Still a sample project is missing. No time for something like this yet ... may be later
+ A browsable project documentation is missing but a all classes and methods are documentated with javadoc (expect the very recent created ones)

20.10.2010 - Version 0.1
+ Added a gui configurator
The class de.cockpit4.sdudaemon.configuration.gui.sduConfigurator has been added.
It enables you to configure the configurations files for sdudaemon confortably.
The configurator is in a very early development state so far only logging, state temp and library path settings are implemented
Further versions shall be able to generate start scripts for cron daemons or other schedulers as well as ability to set database settings and further project details via gui.
If the library path is set the configurator shows you if it founds all neccessary files.

There is no documentation yet, create it with next commitment (may be).

+ Fixed the memory leak
One problem of long term execution is a design oversight in the web harvest plugin framework.
It causes a growing memory usage until the Java Virtual Maschine crashed due lag of memory.
In consequence the XMLManipulatorPlugin now needs the file path where to store your generated file.
It now returns an EmptyVariable only. So further file handling.

+ stabilized XMLManipulator
The XMLManipulator throwed a lot of dispatchable Exceptions. Some of them are fixed or handled.
So The program stability will get better.
+ Added this Changelog
From now on every bigger commit will contain some change information.
