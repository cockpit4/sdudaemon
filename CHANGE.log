20.10.2010 - Version 0.1
+ Added a gui configurator
The class de.cockpit4.sdudaemon.configuration.gui.sduConfigurator has been added.
It enables you to configure the configurations files for sdudaemon confortably.
The configurator is in a very early development state so far only logging, state temp and library path settings are implemented
Further versions shall be able to generate start scripts for cron daemons or other schedulers as well as ability to set database settings and further project details via gui.
If the library path is set the configurator shows you if it founds all neccessary files.

There is no documentation yet, create it with next commitment (may be).

+ Fixed the memory leak
One problem of long term execution is a design oversight in the web harvest plugin framework.
It causes a growing memory usage until the Java Virtual Maschine crashed due lag of memory.
In consequence the XMLManipulatorPlugin now needs the file path where to store your generated file.
It now returns an EmptyVariable only. So further file handling.

+ stabilized XMLManipulator
The XMLManipulator throwed a lot of dispatchable Exceptions. Some of them are fixed or handled.
So The program stability will get better.
+ Added this Changelog
From now on every commit will contain change information.
